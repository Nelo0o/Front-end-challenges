## My process

I created a web page that displays a summary of test results fetched from a JSON file. The page includes a "Your Result" section that shows the user's average score, as well as a "Summary" section that displays individual scores by category. The scores are presented in a visually appealing way using icons and colors.

To achieve this, I used JavaScript to fetch the data from the JSON file and calculate the average score. I then dynamically created HTML elements to display the scores by category. Finally, I added a button for users to continue after viewing their results.

Overall, this web page provides an interactive and engaging way for users to review their test results and learn from their performance.
